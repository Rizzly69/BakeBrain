# Inventory System Implementation Summary

## Overview
The bakery management system now has a comprehensive inventory management system that tracks both raw ingredients and finished products, with automatic inventory reduction when orders are confirmed.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Inventory Decrease on Order Confirmation
- **When an order is confirmed**, the system automatically decreases product inventory quantities
- **Raw material consumption** occurs when products have recipes and need to be made from ingredients
- **Validation** prevents confirming orders when there's insufficient inventory
- **Error handling** provides clear messages for inventory issues

### 2. Inventory Restoration on Order Cancellation
- **When a confirmed order is cancelled**, the system restores product inventory quantities
- **Raw materials are restored** if they were consumed during order confirmation
- **Data integrity** is maintained through database transactions

### 3. Comprehensive Raw Ingredients Database
The system now includes **26 raw ingredients** with various stock levels:

#### ðŸ”´ Out of Stock (5 items)
- Bread Flour - 0.0 kg
- Powdered Sugar - 0.0 kg  
- Baking Soda - 0.0 kg
- Cinnamon - 0.0 kg
- Fresh Apples - 0.0 kg

#### ðŸŸ¡ Short Stock (0 items)
- All items are either out of stock, normal, or overstocked

#### ðŸŸ¢ Normal Stock (18 items)
- All-Purpose Flour - 15.5 kg
- Granulated Sugar - 25.0 kg
- Brown Sugar - 5.5 kg
- Fresh Eggs - 120.0 pieces
- Butter - 8.0 kg
- Milk - 25.0 liters

#### ðŸ”µ Overstocked (3 items)
- Whole Wheat Flour - 45.0 kg
- Vegetable Oil - 30.0 liters
- Water - 100.0 liters

### 4. Product Recipes
**48 recipe ingredients** have been added, linking products to their required raw materials:

- **Artisan Sourdough**: Requires Bread Flour, All-Purpose Flour, Yeast, Salt, Water
- **Croissant**: Requires All-Purpose Flour, Butter, Yeast, Salt, Milk, Sugar
- **Chocolate Chip Cookies**: Requires Flour, Butter, Sugars, Eggs, Vanilla, Baking Soda, Salt, Chocolate Chips
- **Chocolate Cake**: Requires Flour, Sugar, Cocoa Powder, Baking Powder, Baking Soda, Salt, Eggs, Milk, Oil, Vanilla
- **Baguette**: Requires All-Purpose Flour, Yeast, Salt, Water
- **Danish Pastry**: Requires All-Purpose Flour, Butter, Yeast, Milk, Sugar, Vanilla
- **Wedding Cake**: Requires Flour, Sugar, Butter, Eggs, Milk, Vanilla, Baking Powder, Salt

### 5. Finished Product Inventory
**8 products** have inventory levels set up:

#### ðŸ”´ Out of Stock (1 item)
- Artisan Sourdough - 0 units (cannot be made due to missing Bread Flour)

#### ðŸŸ¡ Short Stock (3 items)
- Croissant - 5 units (Min: 15)
- Chocolate Cake - 8 units (Min: 10)
- Wedding Cake - 3 units (Min: 5)

#### ðŸŸ¢ Normal Stock (3 items)
- Chocolate Chip Cookies - 25 units
- Baguette - 15 units
- Danish Pastry - 20 units

#### ðŸ”µ Overstocked (1 item)
- Fresh Coffee - 35 units (Max: 30)

## How the System Works

### Order Flow
1. **Order Creation**: Customer creates order and adds items (no inventory consumed)
2. **Order Confirmation**: Staff confirms order â†’ inventory decreases
3. **Order Cancellation**: Staff cancels confirmed order â†’ inventory restored

### Inventory Logic
1. **Check Finished Product Inventory**: If sufficient, decrease and confirm
2. **Check Raw Materials**: If no finished inventory but recipe exists, check raw materials
3. **Consume Raw Materials**: If sufficient raw materials, consume them and confirm
4. **Error Handling**: If insufficient inventory, prevent confirmation with clear error message

### Testing Scenarios Available

#### Scenario 1: Normal Order (Chocolate Chip Cookies)
- **Product**: Chocolate Chip Cookies (25 units in stock)
- **Result**: Order can be confirmed, inventory decreases to 24 units

#### Scenario 2: Short Stock Order (Croissant)
- **Product**: Croissant (5 units in stock)
- **Result**: Order can be confirmed, but inventory becomes very low (4 units)

#### Scenario 3: Out of Stock Product (Artisan Sourdough)
- **Product**: Artisan Sourdough (0 units in stock, needs Bread Flour which is out of stock)
- **Result**: Order cannot be confirmed, error message shown

#### Scenario 4: Raw Material Production (Chocolate Cake)
- **Product**: Chocolate Cake (8 units in stock, but can be made from raw materials)
- **Result**: Order can be confirmed, raw materials consumed

## Technical Implementation

### Database Models Enhanced
- **Product**: Added methods for inventory checking and raw material consumption
- **Inventory**: Tracks finished product quantities
- **RawProduct**: Tracks raw ingredient quantities
- **ProductRecipe**: Links products to required raw materials

### API Endpoints Modified
- **Order Status Update**: Enhanced to handle inventory management
- **Order Item Addition**: Removed premature raw material consumption

### Error Handling
- **Insufficient Inventory**: Clear error messages with available quantities
- **Missing Raw Materials**: Specific error messages for missing ingredients
- **Transaction Rollback**: Ensures data consistency on errors

## Benefits

1. **Accurate Inventory Tracking**: Real-time inventory levels for both finished products and raw materials
2. **Prevents Overselling**: System prevents confirming orders when inventory is insufficient
3. **Recipe Management**: Automatic raw material consumption based on product recipes
4. **Flexible Production**: Can make products from raw materials when finished inventory is low
5. **Data Integrity**: Transaction-based operations ensure consistent inventory levels
6. **Clear Feedback**: Users get specific error messages about inventory issues

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test Normal Orders**: Try ordering products with sufficient inventory
2. **Test Short Stock**: Order products with low inventory to see warnings
3. **Test Out of Stock**: Try ordering products that cannot be made
4. **Test Raw Material Production**: Order products that need to be made from ingredients
5. **Test Order Cancellation**: Confirm then cancel orders to verify inventory restoration

The system is now ready for comprehensive testing with various inventory scenarios!
